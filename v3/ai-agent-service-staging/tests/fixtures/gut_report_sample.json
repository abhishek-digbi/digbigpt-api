            "description": "Your gut is home to millions of bacteria-some are helpful, and some can cause trouble. The helpful ones play essential roles like fighting off harmful germs, helping you digest food, and keeping your weight and energy balanced. When these good bacteria are present in high amounts, your body will likely stay healthy and strong. On the other hand, too many harmful bacteria can throw your gut off balance. \n\nThis can lead to inflammation, digestive problems, lower immunity, and even increase the risk of conditions like obesity, diabetes, and heart disease. In short, the more good bacteria you have and the fewer bad ones, the better your chances of feeling well and staying healthy.",
